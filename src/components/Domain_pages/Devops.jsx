        DevOps is a collaborative approach that merges development (Dev) and
        operations (Ops) to automate and streamline the software development
        lifecycle. It focuses on enhancing the collaboration between developers,
        IT operations, and other stakeholders to deliver software faster, more
        reliably, and with higher quality. DevOps offers a wide range of
        benefits, including faster delivery, higher quality, increased
        collaboration, better security, and cost savings. By promoting a culture
        of continuous improvement, automation, and collaboration, DevOps helps
        organizations innovate more effectively, reduce risk, and deliver better
        products to their customers.
